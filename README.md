# Version .0.2.4
+ Bug fixing.
+ Last build before RC1
### How to use
####Note, single streams(one movie), is not supported yet, select whole section instead like "Most Viewed"(containing all the most viewed movies in it). 

Add a TV-Show example: 
Open OSMOSIS  > select video option > navigate in to your video addon > search for a TV-Show>
Select the TV-Show, do not open, just select! > open context menu on selected > select "create strm" > select "TV-Shows". 

Now the strm files are located at the path you can configure in OSMOSIS's settings default is: "userdata\addon_data\plugin.video.osmosis/strm" 

After creating strm you will find your stuff in TV, Cinema, TV-Shows, or Others folder, now add this folder to your KODI library and set the content type, done.
