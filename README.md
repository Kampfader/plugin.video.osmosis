Add a TV-Show example: 
Open PseudoLibrary  > select video option > navigate in to your video addon > search for a TV-Show>
Select the TV-Show, do not open, just select! > open context menu on selected > select "create strm" > select "TV-Shows". 

Now the strm files are located at the path you can configure in PseudoLibrary's settings default is: "userdata\addon_data\plugin.video.pseudo.library/strm" 

After creating strm you will find your stuff in TV, Cinema, TV-Shows, or Others folder, now add this folder to your KODI library and set the content type, done.
